//This is for step 3 jsweek2 homework, item #06, arrays. 
//6. Arrays!
//6.1 Declare an empty array.Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element. (See Naming conventions.)
//6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
//6.3 Console.log your array.
//6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside(see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).
//6.5 Log your array.
//6.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal ('baby pig') to the existing array.
//6.7 Log your new array!
