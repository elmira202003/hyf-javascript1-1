//5. How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer(i.e., whole number) ?
//    5.1 Declare a variable z and assign the number 7.25 to it.
//5.2 Console.log z.
//5.3 Declare another variable a that has the value of z but rounded to the nearest integer.
//5.4 Console.log a.
//5.5 So now we have z and a find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.
//5.6 Console.log the highest value.

let z = 7.25;

console.log(z);

let a = Math.round(z);

console.log(a);

if (z > a); {
    let b = z;
    console.log(b);
}
