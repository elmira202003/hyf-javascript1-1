//This is for step 3 jsweek2 homework, item #03, variable X.
"use strict"

    //console.log('the value of my variable x will be: whateverYouThinkItWillLog');

//3.2 Add a console.log statement that explains that explains in words what you think the value of x is, like in this example:
console.log("the value of my variable x will be: number of days in a week.")
